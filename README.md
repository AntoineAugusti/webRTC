# Application test:

## Introduction:

The goal of this test is to create a peer to peer application the send binary data from on browser tab to another, using the RTCDataChannel of the WebRTC HTML5 API.
Web RTC is an API this allows direct client-to-client communication. It's widely used for video chats in the browser, but it can be used for many things, including peer-to-peer video delivery like we do at Streamroot. 

##What's in this repository:

- A set of instruction about the application test itself : [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- An in-dept explanation of WebRTC : [webRTC.md](webRTC.md)
- A simple working webRTC example : [EXAMPLE.md](EXAMPLE.md)
